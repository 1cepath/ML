    "Evaluation\n",
    "you need to train your model using the Train Model module and make predictions on some dataset using the Test Model\n",

    "Cross Validation\n",
    "The input data is split into 10 parts, where one is reserved for testing, and the other 9 for training. This process is repeated 10 times and the evaluation metrics are averaged. This helps in determining how well a model would generalize to new datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cross-validation, the training data is partitioned. The algorithm is trained using all but one of the partitions, and tested on the remaining partition. The partitions are then rotated several times so that the algorithm is trained and evaluated on all of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation provides a more accurate estimate of the model's performance than testing a single partition of the data. "
