    "It is really only suitable when there are an equal number of observations in each class (which is rarely the case) and that all predictions and prediction errors are equally important, which is often not the case. When the classes are imbalanced, i.e., there are a lot more examples of one class than the other, then the accuracy will give a very distorted picture, because the class with more examples will dominate the statistic. In that case, you should look at the per-class accuracy.\n",
