    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in which the predictors are not made independently, but sequentially. Building a model from the training data, then creating a second model that attempts to correct the errors from the first model. Models are added until the training set is predicted perfectly or a maximum number of models are added.  This technique employs the logic in which the subsequent predictors learn from the mistakes of the previous predictors.\n",
