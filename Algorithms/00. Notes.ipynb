    "2. Unsupervised\n",
    "The computer is trained with unlabeled data. These algorithms try to use techniques on the input data to mine for rules, detect patterns, and summarize and group the data points which help in deriving meaningful insights and describe the data better to the users.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Supervised Learning, each example will have a pair of input objects and an output with desired values whereas in Reinforcement Learning Markov’s Decision process means the agent interacts with the environment in discrete steps i.e., agent makes an observation for every time period “t” and receives a reward for every observation and finally the goal is to collect as many rewards as possible to make more observations.\n",

    "\n",
    "when the agent is State 1 and takes Action 2, it will receive a reward of 10 but zero reward if it takes Action 1. In State 2, the situation is reversed and finally State 3 resembles State 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Semi Supervised \n",
    " Includes both labeled and unlabeled data, usually mostly unlabeled. In many practical situations, the cost to label is quite high, since it requires skilled human experts to do that. So, in the absence of labels in the majority of the observations but present in few, semi-supervised algorithms are the best candidates for the model building. \n",
